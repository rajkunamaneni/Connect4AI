# Connect4AI

## Program Description
Play Connect4 with an AI and see if you can beat it!
Connect4 AI uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm and Expectimax Search algorithm with the use of a random argument. 

## Required Libraries

This program requires tkinter and NumPy. To install these libraries, run the following commands in your terminal:

```pip install tkinter```

```pip install numpy```

These commands may not work on your system depending on your Python version. If this is the case, try using ```pip3``` instead of ```pip```.

## Run
- Clone the repository
- Run ```python3 ConnectFour.py [arg1] [arg2]``` in your terminal
- Arguments are AI, Human, and Random. Choose an argument based on how you want to play. 
- Example: ```python3 ConnectFour.py ai human``` will start a game where the AI plays first and the Human plays second.
- Play by inputting the index of the board on the terminal. The corresponding index will be placed on the GUI.
- The game will end when a player wins or the board is full.
